The main file used to run my program is SchedulingAlgorithms.java
This is the file that you will need to compile and run in order to
use the program.

The Process.java file is used to model a Process object and is 
utilized as a helper class in the main class, as mentioned above.

You will need to have the test data text files in the same directory
as the source code I have provided.

Compile all the java files in the directory using: javac *.java
Then run the main file using: java SchedulingAlgorithms

Run the main file, SchedulingAlgorithms.java and you will be greeted 
with a command line interface. It will ask you to type in the name 
of a test data file.

For example, you can type in testdata1.txt. It will then read in all 
of the processes from this file and output the results as csv files 
for each of the scheduling algorithm done on this data.

The menu will then ask you if you would like to try again with a 
different file or if you would like to exit the program.

Thank you,
Abraham Yepremian
